The classic number puzzle game, playable on a **Command Line Interface!**

## Description

This is a low-tech version of the game Sudoku! This game is playable on any command line interface.  
Entering "q" at any time quits the program.  

So far, just the basic logic for generating boards and their solutions is in place. The main game  
script just prints the board and allows the user to quit.
